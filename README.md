# mobius-tunes
This is our submission for HackGT 2015. Mobius Tunes is inspired by [Infinite Jukebox](http://labs.echonest.com/Uploader/index.html), a site that continually and randomly loops a given song to other parts of the song that sound similar. Our goal is to recreate it as an open-source project, allowing for multiple songs within a playlist to link to one another.

pip3 install wave
pip3 install pydub
