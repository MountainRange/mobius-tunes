# mobius-tunes
This is our submission for HackGT 2015. Mobius Tunes is inspired by [Infinite Jukebox](infinitejuke.com), a site that continually and randomly loops a given song to other parts of the song that sound similar. Our goal is to recreate it as an open-source project, allowing for multiple songs within a playlist to link to one another.
 
### Dependencies
```

https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/audioop.html probably has useful things for audio manipulation
